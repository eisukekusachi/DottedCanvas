# DottedCanvas
DottedCanvas is a demo of SwiftUI + SSZipArchive. It allows you to create a dot-pattern image and zip/unzip it.

This app features a canvas and layers. 
The canvas includes sliders to change color, size, and the distance between dots, 
enabling you to create a single dot-pattern image.

The layers allow you to combine multiple dot-pattern images created on the canvas into one, 
enabling you to create a complex dot image by overlaying dots of various colors, sizes, opacities, and offsets.
